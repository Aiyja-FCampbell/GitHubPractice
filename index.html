        <h1>My Name is Aiyja Foose-Campbell</h1>
        <p> I am a proud cat mom of three lovely, yet rambunctious fur babies. In my down time,
            I enjoy getting kitten snuggles while building my next Pinterest board. </p>
        <p>I discovered how cool and interesting coding can be while browing Tik-Tok of all places!</p>
        <p>My favorite time of year is when Autumn is transitioning to what feels like a delayed winter. My end goal
            is to settle down somewhere that actually has a winter.
