# About Me
## My Interests
 - I enjoy collecting mini figurines to display. At the moment, I have a collection of rubber duckies, anime characters, disney figurines and mini Bratz dolls.
 - I would like to venture into crotcheting or doing my own nail extenstions.
## Websites I Recommend
1. [Twitch.tv](www.twitch.tv) - I thoroughly enjoy watching live streams of the various content creators that live stream on this platform.
2. [Ikea](www.ikea.com) - No only is the store an amazing experience but the online website offers a whole lot of virtual tools that make it feel like your in the store!
